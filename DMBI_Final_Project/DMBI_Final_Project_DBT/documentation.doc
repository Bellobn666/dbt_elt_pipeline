1. Which are the top 5 KO reasons, and which percentage of total KO 
    represent each one?

WITH SALES_FACT AS (
SELECT 
	KO_REASON_ID,
	COUNT(KO_REASON_ID) AS KO_COUNT,
    (COUNT(KO_REASON_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(KO_REASON_ID) FROM SALES_FACT) * 100) AS PERCENTAGE,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS DENSE_RANK_NUM
FROM SALES_FACT
GROUP BY KO_REASON_ID
ORDER BY KO_COUNT DESC
)
SELECT 
	KO.KO_REASON,
	KO_COUNT,
	ROUND(PERCENTAGE, 2) AS PERCENTAGE
FROM SALES_FACT SF
LEFT JOIN DIM_KO_REASON KO
	ON SF.KO_REASON_ID = KO.KO_REASON_ID
WHERE DENSE_RANK_NUM <= 5;


2. Which has been the month with more sales of customers that have 
   contracted the cash financing type product? How many sales did that 
   month have?

WITH RANKED_SALES AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE_FORMAT(project_validation_date, '%Y-%m') AS SALES_MONTH,
        COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_SALES,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS DENSE_RANK_NUM
    FROM SALES_FACT SF
    LEFT JOIN DIM_FINANCE_TYPE FT
    ON SF.FINANCE_TYPE_ID = FT.FINANCE_TYPE_ID
    WHERE FT.FINANCE_TYPE = 'cash'
    GROUP BY SALES_MONTH
    HAVING SALES_MONTH IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
    SALES_MONTH,
    TOTAL_SALES
FROM RANKED_SALES
WHERE DENSE_RANK_NUM <= 1;  -- Adjust as needed to filter top N sales months


3. To know if the price of installation affects the financing type, can you 
   obtain a table that shows for each financing type the average 
   installation price? Only consider the individual households for this 
   indicator.

SELECT 
FIN.FINANCE_TYPE AS FINANCE_TYPE,
ROUND(AVG(SALES.INSTALLATION_PRICE), 2) AS AVG_INSTALLATION_PRICE
FROM SALES_FACT SALES
LEFT JOIN DIM_CUSTOMER_TYPE CUST
ON SALES.CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID = CUST.CUSTOMER_TYPE_ID AND CUST.CUSTOMER_TYPE = "Individual Household"
LEFT JOIN DIM_FINANCE_TYPE FIN
ON SALES.FINANCE_TYPE_ID = FIN.FINANCE_TYPE_ID
GROUP BY FIN.FINANCE_TYPE;


4. Only considering the zip codes with more than 5 leads, which is the 
   average peak power, average installation price, number of leads per 
   province?

WITH LEADS_COUNT AS (
	SELECT 
		ZIPCODE,
        COUNT(LEAD_ID) AS LEADS_COUNT,
        SUM(INSTALLATION_PEAK_POWER_KW) AS INSTALLATION_PEAK_POWER,
        SUM(INSTALLATION_PRICE) AS INSTALLATION_PRICE
    FROM SALES_FACT
    GROUP BY ZIPCODE
    HAVING COUNT(LEAD_ID) > 5  -- Fixing HAVING clause
)
SELECT 
	ZC.PROVINCE,
    SUM(LC.LEADS_COUNT) AS NUM_LEADS_PER_PROVINCE,
    ROUND(SUM(LC.INSTALLATION_PEAK_POWER) / SUM(LC.LEADS_COUNT), 2) AS AVG_PEAK_POWER,
    ROUND(SUM(LC.INSTALLATION_PRICE) / SUM(LC.LEADS_COUNT), 2) AS AVG_INSTALLATION_PRICE
FROM LEADS_COUNT LC
	JOIN DIM_ZIPCODE ZC
		ON LC.ZIPCODE = ZC.ZIPCODE
GROUP BY ZC.PROVINCE
ORDER BY NUM_LEADS_PER_PROVINCE DESC;



5. Is average temperature correlated to the sales conversion? Provide a 
   table that contains 3 columns: zip code, sales conversion and 
   average temperature. The sales conversion is calculated dividing the 
   sales done / leads of that zip code. To get the sales done you can filter 
   the leads that are in the “Validated project” phase.

WITH sales_done AS (
SELECT
	sf.zipcode,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN sf.project_validation_date IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS sales_done,
    COUNT(LEAD_ID) AS LEADS_COUNT
FROM sales_fact sf
WHERE sf.current_phase = "Validated project" 
GROUP BY sf.zipcode
),
lead_count AS (
SELECT 
	sf.zipcode,
    COUNT(sf.lead_id) AS lead_count
FROM sales_fact sf
GROUP BY sf.zipcode
),
weather AS (
SELECT 
	zipcode,
    AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature
FROM dim_weather
GROUP BY zipcode
)
SELECT 
	sd.zipcode,
    sd.sales_done,
    lc.lead_count,
    ROUND(CASE 
		WHEN lc.lead_count > 0 THEN (sd.sales_done / lc.lead_count) * 100
            ELSE 0
	END, 2) AS sales_conversion,
	ROUND(w.avg_temperature, 2) AS avg_temperature
FROM sales_done sd
LEFT JOIN lead_count lc
	ON sd.zipcode = lc.zipcode
LEFT JOIN weather w
	ON sd.zipcode = w.zipcode
HAVING sd.zipcode IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY sd.sales_done DESC;
