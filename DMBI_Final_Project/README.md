This project implements a modern data pipeline using dbt (Data Build Tool) to support the sales department of a solar panel installation company. The goal is to build a clean, optimized, and analytics-ready data warehouse that helps track the sales funnel, understand key metrics, and improve lead-to-sale conversion.

We ingested raw sales, weather, and location datasets, cleaned and transformed them into a dimensional model following a star schema, and generated key indicators to support decision-making.
